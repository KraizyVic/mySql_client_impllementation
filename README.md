## Prerequisites:

  - A Computer or Famputer, whichever you own or owns YOU.
  - A little wee bit knowledge of MySql.

  - A capacity to enjoy simple things,

## What to do :

  - Run pub get.
  - Navigate to (lib > database > mysql_client.dart) and change the following(
      - Change the host: "xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx" with host: "YOUR.PC.MACHINE.IP" // If you are running it on a physical device
      - Change the host: "xxxx.xxxx.xxxx.xxxx" with host: "10.0.2.2" // If you are running it on an ANDROID emulator ("For Apple users I'm sorry that I am poor okay")
      - Next Use the THIRD PREREQUISITE that you think you have since you've read this far (In other words it's 1 AM so... use PREREQUISITE NUMERO THRES)
    )
  - Use your WEE BIT KNOWLEDGE IN MYSQL to create and implement tables and other stuff,
